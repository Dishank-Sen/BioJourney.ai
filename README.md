## 🎯 Key Features

### 💬 Conversational AI Chat

Our homepage features a powerful, context-aware chat interface. Users can ask any health-related query and receive intelligent responses from specialized AI personas. The AI maintains a complete history of the conversation and has access to all uploaded documents (like medical reports and food logs) to provide smart, relevant answers.

* **Contextual Memory:** The AI remembers past conversations, even from months ago, ensuring a seamless and intelligent user experience.
* **Specialized AI Personas:** Questions are routed to the appropriate AI agent (e.g., a medication query is answered by "Dr. Warren").
* **Team Communication:** The care team can also send important messages and updates directly through the chat.
