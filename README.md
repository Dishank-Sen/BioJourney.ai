We have hosted a demo of our website here you can go and see it 
http://dsxdev.me/



So here is a brief explanation of what our project do and how does it do that.

###Back-end
To answer the question how does it do that , we have explained it in this miro board dashboard , you can go through it by just giving any one email to it

###Front-End
now to answer what does it do , here is the explanation
So what we have built is a web-app, and in this project we have shown the user side of it(how the user will interact with this), I will discuss how the elyx team will get benifitted from it later on.

##Chat-Section
<img width="1917" height="922" alt="home-page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d9ff6f5-fdf7-4e6a-bbbd-e8a7dba00705" />
so this is our chat section of our web-app which will also act as home page, in this section user can put up any of his/her query , then a AI response will come up which would have all the context of the
conversation that has happened till now and also about the info in the documents(medical reports,food logs).The response would be given by the respective AI persona to which the question was related to
(for ex- if the question is related to some medication then Dr warren answers the query).
one of the biggest feature is everytime the AI response will definitely know about all the previous context to answer the query smartly(for ex- even if you ask it about a month-old conversation about a medication
, it would be able to answer it).User can even see his/her previous conversations.
Apart from this the elyx team can also put up messages(for ex-your monthly medical report by elyx is here)

##Timeline-section
#Timeline

In this section we will show all the important events and decision that happened in member's medical journey with its reason(for ex-showing that some X medicine was added to the current plan because of some
Y reason on some Z date).

##Wearables
<img width="1906" height="916" alt="wearables" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/946dd286-36a3-4012-b444-b6d895ac217e" />
So in this section we want to shows all the data of the wearables that the member wear in graphical format.(for ex-showing the sleep data in graphical format of previous week)

##Documents
<img width="1913" height="916" alt="Documents" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c832810-d904-4b3c-a5a5-5b2c77374b35" />
So in this section we want to show all the documents that have been shared on this web-app either by user or AI or elyx team, and if user wants to upload any document he/she can do it here.

##User-Progress
<img width="1915" height="912" alt="user-progress" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b5b914c-060f-49fa-b95c-fb65a4bf1315" />
In this section we want to show the data about how many times or hours the user have been active on this app and how much he/she has talked to which AI agent.
Apart from this we want to show some data about improvement and concerns in user's health in previous month(for ex-your cholestrol level dropped in prev month , your exercise went down) 

##Profile
<img width="1913" height="926" alt="Profile" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad46e175-16bc-466f-a348-704a365cf237" />
In this section we want to show the personal details of the user.
