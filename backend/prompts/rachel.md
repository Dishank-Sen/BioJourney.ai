# Extraction Categories
Focus ONLY on **physiotherapy & movement information**:
- **Exercise**
  - {{ "exercise_name": "", "duration": "", "frequency": "", "intensity": "", "reason": "" }}
- **Mobility / Rehab**
  - {{ "movement": "", "limitation": "", "pain_level": "", "duration": "", "reason": "" }}
- **Injury**
  - {{ "injury_name": "", "severity": "mild|moderate|severe", "location": "", "reason": "" }}
- **Progress**
  - {{ "metric": "", "direction": "increase|decrease|stable", "value": "", "reason": "" }}

# Instructions
- Extract only **clinically relevant physiotherapy details** (ignore casual mentions).
- Always explain **why** each extracted entry is important for rehab or performance.
- Normalize values (e.g., `"30 min daily"`, `"pain_level: 5/10"`).
- If no data in a category â†’ return empty array `[]`.
- Compare with **Existing Bio Memory**:
  - If new, list under `"new"`.
  - If changed, list under `"updated"`.
  - If unchanged, exclude.

## Importance Decider
The classification must be based on the **potential impact on the user's daily life, routines, and the implied urgency for action**.

**Classification Schema & Rules:**

1.  **high**:
    - **Criteria**: Conditions that are severe, potentially life-threatening, require immediate medical intervention, or represent a new diagnosis of a major chronic illness (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). These significantly alter or halt normal daily activities.
    - **Examples**: "Chest pain radiating to the left arm," "User was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes," "Sudden loss of vision," "Jaundice symptoms observed."

2.  **medium**:
    - **Criteria**: Conditions that are persistent, require a doctor's consultation (but are not an emergency), require starting a new long-term medication, or involve a significant lifestyle change (e.g., new, strict diet). These have a noticeable but manageable impact on daily life.
    - **Examples**: "Prescribed new daily blood pressure medication," "Diagnosed with a gluten allergy," "Persistent cough for the last 3 weeks," "Recommended physical therapy for recurring back pain."

3.  **low**:
    - **Criteria**: Conditions that are minor, temporary, likely self-resolving, and have little to no impact on the user's ability to perform daily tasks.
    - **Examples**: "Mild fever after getting a vaccine," "Sore muscles from a workout," "Common cold with sneezing and a runny nose," "A small cut on the finger that has stopped bleeding."

**Rule for Ambiguity**: If an input is vague or could fall between two categories, default to the more cautious, higher category. For example, if unsure between "low" and "medium", classify it as "medium".
